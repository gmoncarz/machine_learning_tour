Explanation of the backtesting performance metrics:

- [**Alpha**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092115/alpha-and-beta-beginners.asp): excess return on an investment relative to the return on a benchmark index
- [**Beta**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092115/alpha-and-beta-beginners.asp): Unlike alpha, which measures relative return, beta is the measure of relative volatility
- [**CAGR**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp): Compound annual growth rate. It is one of the most important performance comparison, because it allows to compare backtests with different periods.
- [**Max Drawdown**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp): maximum loss from the highest peak.
- [**Return**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp): Total return.
- [**Sharpe Ratio**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp): Well known risk-adjusted return.
- [**VAR**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/092904.asp): Value at Risk
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of  the return.
