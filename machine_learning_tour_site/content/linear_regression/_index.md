The Least Squares linear regression was in fact developed by 
[Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss), with the intention to find the model the movements
of the planets.

Despite it is one of the oldest, it is one of the most used because the simplicity and also because the outputs of the model
can tell you information about the influence of each variable, if they are normalized.
